	/** Automatically generates navmesh graphs based on world geometry.
	 * The recast graph is based on Recast (http://code.google.com/p/recastnavigation/).\n
	 * I have translated a good portion of it to C# to run it natively in Unity.
	 *
	 * \section howitworks How a recast graph works
	 * When generating a recast graph what happens is that the world is voxelized.
	 * You can think of this as constructing an approximation of the world out of lots of boxes.
	 * If you have played Minecraft it looks very similar (but with smaller boxes).
	 * \shadowimage{recast/voxelized_truck.jpg}
	 *
	 * The Recast process is described as follows:
	 * - The voxel mold is build from the input triangle mesh by rasterizing the triangles into a multi-layer heightfield.
	 * Some simple filters are then applied to the mold to prune out locations where the character would not be able to move.
	 * - The walkable areas described by the mold are divided into simple overlayed 2D regions.
	 * The resulting regions have only one non-overlapping contour, which simplifies the final step of the process tremendously.
	 * - The navigation polygons are peeled off from the regions by first tracing the boundaries and then simplifying them.
	 * The resulting polygons are finally converted to convex polygons which makes them perfect for pathfinding and spatial reasoning about the level.
	 *
	 * It works exactly like that in the C# version as well, except that everything is triangulated to triangles instead of n-gons.
	 * The recast generation process usually works directly on the visiable geometry in the world, this is usually a good thing, because world geometry is usually more detailed than the colliders.
	 * You can however specify that colliders should be rasterized, if you have very detailed world geometry, this can speed up the scan.
	 *
	 * Check out the second part of the Get Started Tutorial which discusses recast graphs.
	 *
	 * \section export Exporting for manual editing
	 * In the editor there is a button for exporting the generated graph to a .obj file.
	 * Usually the generation process is good enough for the game directly, but in some cases you might want to edit some minor details.
	 * So you can export the graph to a .obj file, open it in your favourite 3D application, edit it, and export it to a mesh which Unity can import.
	 * You can then use that mesh in a navmesh graph.
	 *
	 * Since many 3D modelling programs use different axis systems (unity uses X=right, Y=up, Z=forward), it can be a bit tricky to get the rotation and scaling right.
	 * For blender for example, what you have to do is to first import the mesh using the .obj importer. Don't change anything related to axes in the settings.
	 * Then select the mesh, open the transform tab (usually the thin toolbar to the right of the 3D view) and set Scale -> Z to -1.
	 * If you transform it using the S (scale) hotkey, it seems to set both Z and Y to -1 for some reason.
	 * Then make the edits you need and export it as an .obj file to somewhere in the Unity project.
	 * But this time, edit the setting named "Forward" to "Z forward" (not -Z as it is per default).
