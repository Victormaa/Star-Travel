F.A.Q.:
------------------

Q: I'm getting a lot of "AABB" errors when testing the demo or importing the effects to my project.

A: This happens in Unity 5.3, and can be fixed by updating to 5.3.1p2 or later versions.

----------------------------------------

Q: I think this pack is missing something / This pack doesn't have an effect like this

A: If you have any suggestions for additional content, feel free to send me an e-mail, and it might just be featured in the next version.

----------------------------------------

Q: My impact effects rotation is odd! 

A: Some of the impact effects default rotation is set to impact at a floor.
This means you will have to script the impact effect to be rotated according to the surface direction.
